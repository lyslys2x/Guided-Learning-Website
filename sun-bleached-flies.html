                        <p>Sun bleached files is one of Ethel’s post death songs, I take it as her reflecting on her life. ‘Sun bleached files’ refer to files that have been left to rot, forgotten on a windowsill. Ethel draws comparison to her life and a pile of flies. I think this song is made in response to American Teenager where she reflects on her childhood and all the points she overlooked. The fact that flies are in the title tie back to tragic parts of the album such as Ptolemaea where the listener can hear flies in the background.

                        <p>These lines refer to mothers, and how Ethel viewed her mother, she saw her mother as someone that was destined to rot like flies and never leave their husbands.

                        <p>Lead paint was commonly used in the album’s setting, lead paint is known to be like poisonous to people. This also ties back to ‘flies’, they are slowly dying both physically and emotionally.
