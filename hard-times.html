                        <p>In Hard Times, Ethel reflects on the tumultuous relationship she had with her deceased father, 
                            the preacher of shady grove, through the course of the song. Listeners can infer the emotional and 
                            physical abuse ethel experienced from her father, and how his abuse shaped her personality. 
                            The title of the song ‘hard times’, signify that the time has past and her father is no longer abusing her anymore.

                        	Ethel is lamenting on how although she has left her Christian religion, she’s constantly reminded about it. The crosses over her body can allude to either her cross tattoos or her mental perception of herself being weighed down by her past religion.

                        <p>This lyric conveys the innocent imagery of a child playing with leaves in the garden, it demonstrates that Ethel’s father’s abuse was secret something that only himself and Ethel is aware of.

                        <p>Lay it on me is often used to deliver difficult or surprising information to somebody, this can mean that Ethel is ready to accept the extent of her father’s abuse. The lyric may also represent the physical action of hitting.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>As Ethel’s father was a well-known preacher in shady grove, after his death, her neighbours and the townsfolk probably speak highly of him. Framing him as a respectable, proper and devoted preacher. Ethel forces herself to agree with their praise despite suffering abuse at his hands. This may demonstrate Ethel’s belief and want for her father to be someone she can trust and love. And also keeping the image her family has.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>Ethel expresses her discontent with her father going unpunished for abusing her, she feels closure (‘happiness’) is only attainable if her abuser gets punished. Since her father died, the truth of his abuse also died with him. Making ethel feel like it’s unfair, this can also allude to the victim mindset of no one believing her even if she told the truth. Not only keeping her abuse secret, but his father can never and will never admit his abuse, so she has no closure.

                        <p>Good guys refer to ethel and her father was the bad guy, she thinks that she ‘conquered’ his abuse, and she deserves to enjoy her life freely now, but she’s upset with the way things are. Because what she really wanted is a caring and loving father figure.

                        <p>When the abuse starts, Ethel is still young and still believes in Christianity, hence the word ‘Praying’ and that her father is good, she idolizes her father in the way many children do and wanted to be like him.

                        <p>Despite Ethel’s father abuse ending with his death, his abuse has eternal impacts on Ethel. ‘Bleeding whenever you want’ refers to the emotional wounds left on Ethel’s psyche; some victims of trauma/abuse may have uncontrollable flashbacks of their abuse.
