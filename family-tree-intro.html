                            <strong>Song Overview:</strong><br>
                            Family Tree (Intro) sets the tone for the entire album, it starts off with a sermon recited, almost inaudible and blending in with the instrumentals. The foreboding tone signifies that this album is not a happy one and Ethel’s story is not also.
                            <br><br><strong>Instrumental:</strong><br>
                            The instrumental is very dark and foreboding, with garbled vocals and occasional distortions in audio, giving the listener a sense of unease. During the chorus, the instrumental mixes with ethel’s heavy eerie vocals, sort of ‘drowning out’ ethel’s voice so that the listener cannot distinguish what she’s singing. I think that this signifies a passive acceptance to the way things are. Even though she’s trying to express her feelings, it’s drowned out by her own instrumental, this signifies that her feelings can’t be heard or understood.

                        <p>
                        	Ethel is lamenting on how although she has left her Christian religion, she’s constantly reminded about it. The crosses over her body can allude to either her cross tattoos or her mental perception of herself being weighed down by her past religion.

                        <p>
                            The bones signify the skeletons that she’s aiming to hide from everybody, instead of hiding them properly everyone can see them. The skeletons can refer to the fact that Ethel Cain is transgender and she’s trying to hide it from everyone.

                    <h3><em>"Jesus can always reject his father, but he can never escape his mother’s blood"<br><br>
                        "He will scream and try to wash it off of his fingers, but he will never escape of what he is made up of

                        <p>                       
                        These lyrics draws comparison between Jesus and Ethel’s life and their relationship with parental figures. Mother Mary was a virgin when she had Jesus, being a son of God, Jesus inherited certain genetics and traits passed down solely from his mother and not his father, reinstating that although he may be able to ‘escape’ his father, he can’t escape what has been passed down by his mother.
                        However, unlike Jesus, Ethel cannot reject her father, as seen from the album’s title of ‘Preacher’s Daughter’, Ethel’s identity is deeply ingrained in who her father was, the town’s beloved preacher. Her identity is always linked to Christianity, God and the church even if she wants to reject it/leave it behind.

                        <p>                       
                            Ethel can’t control her fate on being born in an Orthodox Christian family much more than she can control who she is. A large part of her personality is shaped by the environment in which she grew up in. ‘Swinging by my neck from the Family Tree’ signifies that her death was not only caused by her actions but also stems her upbringing and relationship with her family members.</p>

                    <h3><em>"He’ll laugh and say, ‘You know I raised you better than this, then leave me hanging so they all can laugh at me"</em></h3>
                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>                       
                        	The ‘he’ in line refers to her father, her father does not acknowledge his part in contributing to her death. Claiming that he raised her better than this, which is ironic as ethel’s personality and actions were directly shaped by how her father raised her.
                            The laughter can be a reference to her song ‘Homecoming’ in which there’s a lyric stating ‘they’re all gonna laugh at me’. ‘Homecoming’ references Stephen King’s book, Carrie, where a girl is shunned at her new for being different from others, therefore the lyrics ‘So they all can laugh at me’ may represent Ethel’s feelings of shame and exclusion. 
                            Additionally, the laughter can signify the townspeople gossiping about her and judging her and her father does to quell the rumours and even gossips with them. Further shunning and excluding Ethel.

                            In conclusion, Family Tree (into) covers Ethel’s attitude towards her family, 
                            the way Ethel’s family treated her and her attitudes on religion, specifically Christianity. <br><br>
                            Through Family Tree (intro), we understand that Ethel feels alienated from her family members and
                            friends, she desires to escape and be someone else, however she can never truly leave her ancestry behind.
                            This mindset reinforces the theme of intergenerational and family trauma, even when Ethel leaves her environment,
                            the lasting imprints of childhood trauma and lineage trauma will stay with her forever. <br><br>
                            This trauma influences her actions, behaviours and emotions over the course of the album, hence setting the perfect
                            stage and context for the rest of Preacher’s Daughter.
