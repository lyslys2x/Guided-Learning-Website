                        Family Tree details the death of Ethel’s boyfriend, Logan Phelps, after he got caught for robbing banks and shot to death by police,
                         the death of Logan also severs Ethels last connection with the town of Shady Grove, 
                         allowing her to leave Shady Grove behind her once and for all and the start of act 2 of the album.<br><br>
                        The song is the same as ‘Family Tree (Intro)’ but just with a few additional lyrics. I think the title is the same because it signifies
                        the end of Ethel's relationship with her family. As seen from the newspaper clippings, Logan was shot while running away from a bank robbery.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>I think this lyric implies that Ethel’s mother and father were constantly arguing and they used their children as an excuse to stay together with one another.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>The preacher refers to her father (preacher’s daughter), Ethel sees a sort of dissonance between her father as her ‘daddy’ and the ‘preacher’, the ‘preacher’ is someone to be respected no matter what to stay silent in front of, suggesting that his father has his way a lot. ‘that man’ can also refer to god, and Ethel’s father is only scared when facing god.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>Ethel’s father is the kind of person to accuse people without really thinking, and he doesn’t reflect on his actions and thoughts. This kind of impulsive mindset and personality influenced Ethel.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>This lyric can refer to baptism, during baptism, the person is immersed in holy water washing away their sins. With Logan, Ethel feels like she can start anew.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>The imagery of a white horse is a knight and a princess, Ethel feels like Logan is her knight that will save her from reality, ‘the chapel’ refers to marriage. Like the previous lyric, ‘wash over’ can refer to baptism, where Ethel feels like a new person after being with Logan. So in this lyric she is saying that she would marry Logan and they will live a happily ever after, where Ethel is different and renewed, far away from her current reality.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>In family tree (intro), Ethel is the one hanging from the noose and being judged by others, having no control over it. Conversely, now Ethel is taking fate in her own hands by leaving Shady Grove.

                        <p>Ethel feels wronged and angry because Logan got gunned down and killed.

                        <p>Ethel say she killed before, this can be why she is in hell, alternatively her trauma and environment may already feel like hell to her hence she is not scared of it.
