                        American Teenager is where Ethel’s Story really starts, in the song, 
                        Ethel is introduced as a typical teenager with a bit of a drinking problem, curious about the world around her and still 
                        deeply religious, she is optimistic of her life, like how a teenager should be. <br><br>
                        In an interview, Hayden mentioned that when she was younger, she believed she 
                        could be the one to change everything, that her dreams were achievable and that if nothing else, she should at least die trying. 
                        She wrote this song to express her frustration with the things she thought an ‘American Teenager’ was supposed to
                         be but never had any real chance of becoming.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <div class="section-layout">
                    <h3><em>"Grew up under yellow light on the street, putting too much faith in the make-belief and another highschool football team."</em></h3>
                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>	Yellow light symbolises God’s presence and divinity, Ethel was raised in a devout Christian community and was probably 
                            sheltered from the ‘real world’, the consequent lyric is where Ethel slowly wakes up 
                            and realises that her sheltered life is far from reality. It also demonstrates Ethel’s naïve and optimistic personality.
                        </p>

                    <h3><em>"The neighbour’s brother came home in a box, but he wanted to go so maybe it was his fault, another red heart taken by the American Dream."</em></h3>
                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>
                            Ethel reflects on her neighbour dying overseas after serving in the military, she thinks he may be responsible for his own death, 
                            yet she empathises with his desire to chase the American Dream. In America, soldiers can receive university scholarships and money 
                            for their service which are ingredients for the American Dream. Instead of pursuing his education and living his life as a teenager, 
                            he’s risking his life, and eventually losing it, for a chance at the American Dream. 
                            This aligns with Hayden’s sentiments towards being an American Teenager, her neighbour had no real chance of being one.

                    <h3><em>"And I feel you there In the middle of the night When the lights go out and I'm all alone again."</em></h3>
                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>Ethel is saying that she feels God when she’s all by herself, but despite his presence she feels all alone, this could mean that she prays at night for a better life, however it never got better for her, hence she feels alone, like God never helped her.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>I think this lyric implies that Ethel’s mother and father were constantly arguing and they used their children as an excuse to stay together with one another.
