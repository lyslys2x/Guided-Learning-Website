                        <p>Ptolemaea is a horrifying track, through the song you feel Ethel’s deep fear, confusion and anxiety of her situation,
                             drugged and forced into prostitution by Isaiah. Ethel clearly had no notion of the world around her, lost in the haze of drugs. 
                             <br><br>In Dante’s Inferno, Ptolemaea refers to the 3rd ring in the ninth circle of hell specifically reserved for those that betrayed their family and friends, suggesting that Ethel thinks that her current actions are disgraceful to her family and friends back in Shady Grove.

                        <p>This line is said by Isaiah, he implies that she is the perpetrator and the one fault for what happened to her. This is a common manipulation technique used by abusers to make them seem like the victim and make the real victim trust them more. ‘Invited you twice’ refers to Isaiah inviting her on the journey to California and into his heart.

                        <p>The blood can refer to Ethel’s belief in her family and love for her family, I think this line is a play on the violence Isaiah is willing to commit and how fundamentally different he is from Ethel.

                        <p>Isaiah says this also, the repeated and distorted voice signifies that Ethel’s psyche is slipping away due to the drugs.
