                        ‘A House in Nebraska’ is Ethel reminiscing about her past lover, Willoughby Tucker and how their relationship ended. 
                        Ethel notably reflects on their memories they shared in an abandoned house in Nebraska far away from 
                        their hometown of shady grove. <br><br> Although ‘A House in Nebraska’ does not cover Ethel and Willoughby’s love story, the song conveys 
                        the importance their relationship to Ethel. Ethel believed that their love was perfect and could withstand anything, 
                        reflecting her naivety and desire to be loved and to love someone else. Ethel views their time together as an escape from the struggles of 
                        ‘real life’, which is why she still clings on to their time together.</p>

                        <p>This imagery depicts illnesses resulting in heavy breathing/breathlessness and not being able to leave the bed. It can also refer to Ethel and Willoughby staying in that house for a long time.

                    <div class="lyrics">
                        <p>This implies that Ethel and Willoughby were comfortable and content with each other and enjoyed spending time in silence, the lyric may also allude to a song titled ‘The sound of Silence’ written by Simon and Garfunkel about how people cannot communicate effectively to each other, suggesting that Ethel and Willoughby sat in silence because they weren’t able to communicate properly.

                            Ethel was so in love with Willoughby that she thought it could conquer everything, she was so enamoured with Willoughby that she placed her entire world of him, this lyric is reminiscent of the obsessive nature of first love.

                        <p>Despite her illusion being shattered, Ethel clings to her feelings and believes that she felt most at ease then. We can

                        <p>Though the house was dingy, unclean and rugged, not a place where love could blossom, Ethel and Willoughby still fell in love deeply. This may allude to the suppressive environment Ethel grew up with and how despite that she found love in Willoughby.

                            These lines reiterate how important Willoughby was and still is to Ethel, she once placed Willoughby at the centre of her universe, wanting so badly to be with him forever and for their perfect love to last forever. Her emotions were also heavily dependent on Willoughby and may be one of the reasons Willoughby left her.

                        <p>Ethel’s praying demonstrates her desperation for Willoughby to return to her side. Although Ethel has her doubts in god and in religion, she is willing to do anything for Willoughby to come back to her side.

                        <p>Ethel has a level of concern and care towards Willoughby that is odd, throughout the past 3 songs, we don’t really see Ethel expressing her emotions, but she does on this track and ever since House in Nebraska we see Ethel expressing more of her emotions and opening up. Willoughby and Ethel’s relationship may have been one of purely circumstances, yet the love that Ethel feels for him is real, in this line she describes him as an old friend that she misses and wishes well to. It’s evident that Ethel is slowly letting go of Willoughby but their relationship will eternally shape Ethel.
