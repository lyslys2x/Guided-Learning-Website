                    <p>This project was created so I could research on the lore behind “Preachers Daughter” by Ethel Cain
                        as I am passionate about Ethel Cain's music and how she weaves a story into every album. I want to
                        create an interactive website to convey the story of “Preachers Daughter” in a audiovisual manner.
                        So that more people can find different ways to enjoy her art.

                    <img src="./images/deer.png">
                    <p>During week 1, my Learning Facilitator and I discussed my learning contract, this learning contract planned
                        out my roadmap and 'to-do list' for the entire guided learning subject. Initially, I really wanted to create a 15 minute long 
                        video essay to explain the intricasies of "Preachers Daughter", however my LF voiced her concerns that I may not be 
                        able to complete the project due to time and coursework constraints. After the consultation, I reflected and realised that
                        I was having <strong>really high</strong> expectations for myself to flim the video but her feedback caused me to relax and 
                        place less pressure on myself to do a 15 minute long video, instead, I started considered filming a shorter video.

                    <img src="./images/deer.png">
                    <p>Week 2 was when I created a website shell on figma, many of the elements were tough to configure such as,
                        figuring out scrolling and linking pages together. To resolve this problem, 
                        I watched videos on figma on YouTube to more efficiently design websites. 
                        I also researched online for reusable Figma libraries that contain elements I can consistently reuse, 
                        this improves efficiency as I don’t need to copy and paste from flaticon, which I have been doing.</p>

                    <img src="./images/deer.png">
                    <p>After watching the videos on LinkedIn Learning I came to the conclusion
                        that the length of the video wasn't very important. I learnt that the most important things
                        are my target audience and end goal. Therefore instead of creating a long video,
                        I decided to do a short hook video that can be incorporated into my website.
                        This video will be in the format of a news report.</p>

                    <p>I typically use LLMs to generate scripts. However this time I gave myself a challenge, 
                        instead of completely relying on chatgpt to ideate and editing afterwards. 
                        I decided to ideate on my script before using ChatGPT to improve it.</p>

                    <p>While coding I would usually use LLMs however, I want to learn how to code without LLMs so
                        instead I used W3 School as resource to customizd the CSS (styles) of the website.
                        Although LLMs are much faster, I think it's important to have a clear idea of the basics before 
                        letting LLMs do all the work because I wont learn anything this way.</p>
