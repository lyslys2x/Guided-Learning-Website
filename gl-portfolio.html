                        This project was created so I could research on the lore behind “Preachers Daughter” by Ethel Cain
                        as I am passionate about Ethel Cain's music and how she weaves a story into every album. I want to
                        create an interactive website to convey the story of “Preachers Daughter” in a audiovisual manner.
                        So that more people can find different ways to enjoy and understand her art. <br><br>

                        <p style="text-align: start;">During week 1, my Learning Facilitator (LF) and I discussed my learning contract, this learning contract planned
                            out my roadmap and 'to-do list' for the entire guided learning subject. Initially, I really wanted to create a 15 minute long 
                            video essay to explain the story of "Preachers Daughter", however my LF voiced her concerns that I may not be 
                            able to complete the project due to time and coursework constraints. <br><br> After the consultation, I reflected and realised that
                            I was having <strong>really high</strong> expectations for myself to film the video but her feedback caused me to relax and 
                            place less pressure on myself to do a 15 minute long video, from this consultation session, I started considered filming a shorter video.
                            Before the consultation, I wanted my GL project to be perfect, the video edited at an expert level and a full-fledged
                            story game, however, after the consultation I was able to manage my expectations and refocus myself to the goal, whcih was a deep dive into
                            Preacher's Daughter. To accomplish this goal, in the following weeks, I will focus on analysing the lyrics and sonic choices in each song.

                        <p><strong>Planning the Website:</strong> Whilst planning the website I initially wanted to create a visual novel for the entire story using 
                            RenPy to allow users to experience Ethel’s story for themselves. However, I did not have time to 
                            do that so I unfortunately scraped that idea, I feel that although I did not execute the visual novel idea,
                            it taught me about time management and not putting too much on my plate because if I do so all my 
                            guided learning deliverables won’t be of highest quality, it’s better to focus on 1 or 2 things and execute it well. 
                            I remember I was trying to learn RenPy while making my website and I was extremely overwhelmed because I had never used 
                            RenPy before and it was challenging to navigate. 
                            In the end I decided to just focus on creating the video, building my website and its content. For the website,
                            I went with a brown, gothic, wooden-ish theme as it matches the album cover. <br>

                        <p><strong>Planning the Video:</strong> I had a few ideas for the video, either I create a short video essay introducing 
                            preacher’s daughter or I go with a more thematic approach. Initially, I went with the thematic approach. 
                            So, for the thematic approach, I chose to do a mock news report on the death of Ethel cain, as an aftermath
                            of the gruesome things that happened to her. The news report was simply reporting her death, how she died
                            and the reactions of Shady Grove townsfolk after her death. I thought it would be fitting because 
                            Preacher’s Daughter is a story, and a news report fits chronologically in the timeline of the story. <br><br>

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Perfoming Stage:</strong> After planning I filmed the video using my laptop computer and did some minor editing on clipchamp, 
                            I added static and an old TV to emulate the vibes 
                            of Preacher’s Daughter since it was set in 1980 so I thought that it would match the theme. <br><br>
                            <strong>Monintoring Stage:</strong> I showed my video to my learning facilitator, and she helped me realise that when 
                            conceptualizing the video I did not consider the audience and my video did not have a 
                            central theme or call to action that was related to my project goals of performing a deep dive on Preachers Daughter.
                            I knew that I needed to rethink and ideate on what my video should be because ideally, at the very least, 
                            it should be related to my website, which is explanations of the lyrics in the album. I came out with doing a 
                            short introduction on what the Album is, who is Ethel and the summary of all tracks.
                            Therefore, I decided to focus more on the website content in the following weeks and use the content I studied as a basis
                            for my video.
