                        This project was created so I could research on the lore behind “Preachers Daughter” by Ethel Cain
                        as I am passionate about Ethel Cain's music and how she weaves a story into every album. I want to
                        create an interactive website to convey the story of “Preachers Daughter” in a audiovisual manner.
                        So that more people can find different ways to enjoy and understand her art. <br><br>
                        Furthermore, I have always been intrigued about the story behind the album and this project provides an oppotunity
                        for me to understand and appreciate her art. Through this project I aim to improve my digital fluency by challenging my website
                        coding skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), improve my communication skills by effectively communicating my ideas<br><br>

                        <p style="text-align: start;">During week 1, my Learning Facilitator (LF) and I discussed my learning contract, this learning contract planned
                            out my roadmap and 'to-do list' for the entire guided learning subject. Initially, I really wanted to create a 15 minute long 
                            video essay to explain the story of "Preachers Daughter", however my LF voiced her concerns that I may not be 
                            able to complete the project due to time and coursework constraints. <br><br> After the consultation, I reflected and realised that
                            I was having <strong>really high</strong> expectations for myself to film the video but her feedback caused me to relax and 
                            place less pressure on myself to do a 15 minute long video, from this consultation session, I started considered filming a shorter video.
                            Before the consultation, I wanted my GL project to be perfect, the video edited at an expert level and a full-fledged
                            story game, however, after the consultation I was able to manage my expectations and refocus myself to the goal, whcih was a deep dive into
                            Preacher's Daughter. To accomplish this goal, in the following weeks, I will focus on analysing the lyrics and sonic choices in each song.

                        <p><strong>Planning the Website:</strong> Whilst planning the website I initially wanted to create a visual novel for the entire story using 
                            RenPy to allow users to experience Ethel’s story for themselves. However, I did not have time to 
                            do that so I unfortunately scraped that idea, I feel that although I did not execute the visual novel idea,
                            it taught me about time management and not putting too much on my plate because if I do so all my 
                            guided learning deliverables won’t be of highest quality, it’s better to focus on 1 or 2 things and execute it well. 
                            I remember I was trying to learn RenPy while making my website and I was extremely overwhelmed because I had never used 
                            RenPy before and it was challenging to navigate. <br><br>
                            In the end I decided to just focus on creating the video, building my website and its content. For the website,
                            I went with a brown, gothic, wooden-ish theme as it matches the album cover. The website will focus on lyrical choices in
                            Preacher's Daughter, with in depth explanation of why Ethel chose these lyrics and what it means for the song.<br>

                        <p><strong>Planning the Video:</strong> I had a few ideas for the video, either I create a short video essay introducing 
                            preacher’s daughter or I go with a more thematic approach. Initially, I went with the thematic approach. 
                            So, for the thematic approach, I chose to do a mock news report on the death of Ethel cain, as an aftermath
                            of the gruesome things that happened to her. The news report was simply reporting her death, how she died
                            and the reactions of Shady Grove townsfolk after her death. I thought it would be fitting because 
                            Preacher’s Daughter is a story, and a news report fits chronologically in the timeline of the story. <br><br>

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Perfoming [Video]:</strong> After planning I filmed the video using my laptop computer and did some minor editing on clipchamp, 
                            I added static and an old TV to emulate the vibes 
                            of Preacher’s Daughter since it was set in 1980 so I thought that it would match the theme. <br><br>
                            <strong>Monintoring Stage:</strong> I showed my video to my learning facilitator, and she helped me realise that when 
                            conceptualizing the video I did not consider the audience and my video did not have a 
                            central theme or call to action that was related to my project goals of performing a deep dive on Preachers Daughter.
                            I knew that I needed to rethink and ideate on what my video should be because ideally, at the very least, 
                            it should be related to my website, which is explanations of the lyrics in the album. I came out with doing a 
                            short introduction on what the Album is, who is Ethel and the summary of all tracks.
                            Therefore, I decided to focus more on the website content in the following weeks and use the content I studied as a basis
                            for my video.

                        <p>Performing [Website]: For me, the content was an issue. In my proposal I stated that I wanted to demonstrate skills of 
                            effective communication through this GL project, the was because I am not an extremely proficient writer, 
                            I have challenges in putting my thoughts to words. This lack of skill was demonstrated in my GL project, 
                            I did not know how to explain lyrics. So, initially I would just describe lyrics with 1 line. For example, 
                            the lyric: “And I feel so alone, and I feel so alone out here”, my evaluation: “The song closes with Ethel’s pain 
                            and longing for their relationship.” I just felt like I had so much more to say but I was not able to articulate 
                            it properly and it made me really frustrated.<br><br>
                             To address this gap, I educated myself about Hayden Ahedonia (Person behind ethel cain), 
                            I would read and watch her interviews to get a grasp on her character so I can explain the album better. 
                            I also read through genius annotations on the lyrics, watched tiktok videos on Preachers Daughter and 
                            scrolled through reddit to have a grasp on how people interpreted her lyrics. I have linked my references below.

                        <p>For coding the website, I used the Figma drafts as reference, what I found challenging is I could
                             not make a one-to-one copy of my draft on Figma. So, I had to improvise and change the final design 
                             slightly, I think that my final design is better than the Figma draft. Other than that, 
                             the coding went smoothly, one technique I used to save time was reusing elements instead of rewriting styles, 
                             for example, I consistently used the same 'section' element across all pages. Since the styling was already defined, 
                            this reduced repetitive coding. Another challenge I faced was deploying the website onto Github, which is a 
                            free service to deploy HTML websites. The audio and video files I used in my website were too large to be uploaded, 
                            whilst trying to resolve this, I panicked and almost rewrote my entire project with the original
                             Github commit (barebones website). Luckily, I managed to restore the most recent commit. To solve this problem,
                              I uploaded my large files Github releases and used the link they provided to use the resource in my project.

                        <p>I did not do much these few weeks as I had exams and I went overseas for holidays,
                             I continued working on coding the website, the content and refining my e-portfolio. 
                             I felt that explaining the story behind the song before diving into the lyric interpretation
                              provided the additional context each song needed to be understood. I also made the background of 
                              each song page a different picture and have a different vibe. During this time, 
                              I focused on applying the things I learnt such as code, Preacher’s Daughter etc., 
                              resizing elements on the website, reading up on ethel cain and preacher’s daughter. 
                              It was really time consuming hence I spent so many weeks finalizing the design and content. 
                              Another thing that really helped was writing the content in a word document. 
                            This allowed the words to be more interpretable and for me to better track my progress.

                        <p>I had a consultation session this week and I showed my video to my learning facilitator, she helped me realise that when 
                            conceptualizing the video I failed to consider the target audience so my video did not have a central theme or 
                            call to action that was related to my project goals of performing a deep dive on Preachers Daughter. I knew that I needed to rethink and 
                            ideate on what my video should be because ideally, at the very least, it should be related to the core theme of the project.
                            After talking to my LF, I came up with the new idea of doing a short introduction on "Preacher's Daughter",
                            who is Ethel and a basic summary of all tracks.

                            I spent this week re-recording the video, specifically I recorded only my voice using it as the backing narrations
                            and edited clips from Ethel cain's videos for the full video. I decided to change the format because when making the first video,
                            where I flimed my face, I had to retake it many times because I forgot certains lines. With my voice as a backing narration, I can 
                            look at script while recording my lines, so do not need to retake it as many times.

                        <p>When editing the second video, I used capcut for video editing and clipchamp for the captions. This is because capcut is less laggy
                            and had more in-built transitions and animations. I wanted to try editing with a new software also, I used with clipchamp
                            for subtitle generation because it auto-generates subtitles which saves time when adding subtitles. Since clipchamp made mistakes
                            I also checked if every subtitle was corrrect. I showed my video to my LF and she said it's better than the previous video,
                            I was so happy that I learnt from my mistakes and created a video I am proud of.

                            using clipchamp and a video of a spinning vinyl I found on Youtube. I also added a play button for the songs so viewers can 
                            listen to the songs while exploring my website. This week I just focused on my E-portfolio content and making sure
                            that all areas were well elaborated on.

                        <p>The more I explored Preacher’s Daughter the more I regretted choosing this album
                             because there were many taboo topics being brought up, before this project I was only aware of the 
                             overarching plotline where Ethel grows up repressed in shady grove, runs away from home, get murdered and cannibalised. 
                             I was so shocked to learn the meaning behind the lyrics. I learnt that instead of assuming that I knew what “Preacher’s Daughter” 
                             was and rushing into analysing it, I should have researched more into it. 
                             But since I already committed to it, I wanted to make sure that I covered appropriately in a school context and in a 
                            way that would convey the main gist of the story. So, I omitted a few annotations and observations.

                        <p>I learnt that my first video which is the one where I made a news report format, 
                            needed more editing and overall, it was a confusing video. Although my second 
                            video where I gave a summary on Preacher’s Daughter was more concise and relevant 
                            to the website which I was happy with. There are some areas for improvement that 
                            I was not able to complete due to time constrains, such as improving the audio quality, despite using a 
                            microphone the audio was still muffled, and it really impacted the production quality.

                        <p>It took so long to code the website and find the content, the content took longer because I had to understand each lyric and story 
                            behind the song which was challenging because the meaning behind her songs, lyrics and instrumentals are up to 
                            listener’s interpretation so I could not use the interpretations of other’s as a starting point, 
                            I had to analyse interviews and videos to come to my own conclusions. The website took so long because 
                            I had to code everything out on my own and despite being from an IT course, there were many elements 
                            I wanted to use that I did not learn through my coursework such as github releases (to upload large audio and video files) and carousels, 
                            so I relied on ChatGPT, w3schools and geeksforgeeks to learn. This process reminded me to not be so 
                            complacent and assume that just because I have a coding background, coding the website would be easy. 
                            However, I am really proud of how my website looks and the content in my website, although the content may not be 100% accurate, 
                            I know that I referred to as many primary sources as possible when writing it and tried my best.
