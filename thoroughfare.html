                        In Throughfare, Ethel meets her next love interest, Isaiah. Isaiah invites her to join him on his truck journey to California, promising a bright, rich future to Ethel. Believing him and having nothing to lose after running away from home, Ethel decides to join him. Throughout the journey, Ethel and Isaiah find themselves attracted to one another. Throughfare details Ethel’s hopefulness of her life taking a turn, Thoroughfare is also the 7th Track of the 13 Track album, signalling a break in which Ethel believes she can shed her old self and become someone new. An important thing to note is a newspaper clipping of Ethel stated that she was kidnapped by a guy, however thoroughfare pushes the narrative that she joined Isaiah willingly.</p>
