                        In Throughfare, Ethel meets her next love interest, Isaiah. Isaiah invites her to join him on his truck journey to California, promising a bright, rich future to Ethel. Believing him and having nothing to lose after running away from home, Ethel decides to join him. Throughout the journey, Ethel and Isaiah find themselves attracted to one another. Throughfare details Ethel’s hopefulness of her life taking a turn, Thoroughfare is also the 7th Track of the 13 Track album, signalling a break in which Ethel believes she can shed her old self and become someone new. An important thing to note is a newspaper clipping of Ethel stated that she was kidnapped by a guy, however thoroughfare pushes the narrative that she joined Isaiah willingly.</p>

                        <p>Isaiah also wanted a love story like his parents, this may mean that his parents relationship was violent also due to the abuse he made Ethel suffer through.

                        <p>This matches the news report of ethel, the fact that she was in torn up clothes shows that she was on the run for a long time and Isaiah probably thought she was an easy target.</p>
