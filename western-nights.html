                        Now back to the present, ‘Western Nights’ details Ethel’s new relationship with her abusive boyfriend, Logan Phelps,
                         who rides a motorcycle and robs banks for fun. Ethel still believes in true love despite what happened with Willoughby, 
                         she convinces herself that Logan’s abuse is the love she has been craving. <br><br>
                         A western night refers to a themed party 
                         featuring cowboy/cowgirl attire, which may be how Logan and Ethel’s relationship feels like to her.
                        An interesting point to note is Alabama is in south America, not the west, since Ethel is talking about western nights, the 
                        distinction of locations suggests that Ethel may have ran away from home with Logan.<br><br>
                        The fact that 'night' is in the title implies that they may not have a stable place to stay and spend their nights riding around on
                        Logan's motorcycle. It may also mean that night time is where Ethel feels most connected to Logan.

                        <p>A Harley refers to ‘Harley Davidson’, a popular motorcycle brand in America, the brand is commonly associated with biker gangs which may be what Logan is in as he performs bank robberies as a source of income. From the moment Ethel saw him, she was infatuated with him, his looks and demeanour.

                        <p>This can refer to their love being so passionate that they had to sleep with each other every day or also the summer season where students have their holidays. Since Ethel does not need to go to school, she has the freedom to be with Logan everyday.

                        <p>Logan was a violent individual, and he was abusive to Ethel instead of running away Ethel viewed his abuse as love. ‘like you do’ can signify that Ethel is reminded of someone she knows, maybe her father but she thinks fondly of this person too.

                        <p>Ethel and Logan have a very passionate relationship, with Logan she need not feel the need to pretend, and she can be free. ‘neighbour’s beat on the wall’ Ethel is unapologetically loud, being who she wants to be, this also shows her rebellious streak.

                        <p>Logan is not a good influence; we know that he robs banks and engages in criminal activities. Ethel idealises this life of trouble, wanting to be with him no matter what.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">Unlike other songs on the album, western nights does not really say much and a lot of the lyrics can be understood at face value. Instead it gives us a glimpse into Ethel’s present and the types of romantic relationships she’s having, which is violent yet she romanticises it, Western nights is a key part of understanding Ethel’s character and the story of Preacher’s Daughter.
